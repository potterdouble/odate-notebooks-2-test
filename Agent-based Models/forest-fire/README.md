# Forest Fire Model

## Summary

The [forest fire model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model) is a simple, cellular automata simulation of a fire spreading through a forest. The forest is a grid of cells, each of which can either be empty or contain a tree. Trees can be unburned, on fire, or burned. The fire spreads from every on-fire tree to unburned neighbors; the on-fire tree then becomes burned. This continues until the fire dies out.

### ``ForestFireModel.py``

This defines the model. There is one agent class, **TreeCell**. Each TreeCell object which has (x, y) coordinates on the grid, and its condition is *Fine* by default. Every step, if the tree's condition is *On Fire*, it spreads the fire to any *Fine* trees in its [Von Neumann neighborhood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood) before changing its own condition to *Burned Out*.

The **ForestFire** class is the model container. It is instantiated with width and height parameters which define the grid size, and density, which is the probability of any given cell having a tree in it. When a new model is instantiated, cells are randomly filled with trees with probability equal to density. All the trees in the left-hand column (x=0) are set to *On Fire*.

Each step of the model, trees are activated in random order, spreading the fire and burning out. This continues until there are no more trees on fire -- the fire has completely burned out.
